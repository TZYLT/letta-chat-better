# Scheduling Tasks

This skill lets you create, list, and manage scheduled tasks using the `letta cron` CLI. Scheduled tasks send a prompt to the agent on a timer — useful for reminders, periodic check-ins, and deferred follow-ups.

For ordinary one-shot or recurring work in the current conversation, use Wake instead. Wake is self-bound and covers create, list, and cancel without routing choices.

## When to Use This Skill

- The task should run in a fresh, default, or different conversation
- You need run history, replacement, or broader schedule inspection
- Wake cannot see or manage the schedule you need

## Where Schedules Run

Every schedule is device-local. It lives in `~/.haruyuki/crons.json` and fires from the Letta process on this computer:

- A schedule only fires while a Letta session is running on this computer. A fire that comes due while nothing is running is recorded as missed and is not replayed later.
- There is no runner selection flag and no remote target. `--computer` is rejected, and a schedule cannot run on another computer or in a hosted sandbox.

## CLI Usage

All commands go through `letta cron` via the Bash tool. Output is JSON.

### Creating a Task

```bash
letta cron add --name <short-name> --description <text> --prompt <text> <schedule>
```

**Required flags:**

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--name <text>` | Short identifier for the task (e.g. "dog-walk-reminder") |
| `--description <text>` | Human-readable description of what the task does |
| `--prompt <text>` | The message that will be sent to the agent when the task fires |

**Schedule (pick one):**

| Flag | Type | Example |
|------|------|---------|
| `--every <interval>` | Recurring (cron shorthand) | `5m`, `2h`, `1d` |
| `--at <time>` | One-shot | `"in 45m"`, `"2026-09-24T09:00:00-07:00"` |
| `--cron <expr>` | Raw cron (recurring) | `"0 9 * * 1-5"` |

Exactly one of the three is required. `--once` is accepted with `--at` (already one-shot there) and rejected with `--cron`.

**Optional flags:**

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--agent <id>` | Agent ID (defaults to `LETTA_AGENT_ID` from the current shell/session) |
| `--conversation <id>` | Conversation target: omit or pass `new` for a fresh conversation per fire; pass `self` for the current conversation; pass `default` for the agent default; or pass a concrete ID |

`--computer` is accepted by the parser only so it can be rejected with a clear error. There is no way to run a schedule anywhere but this computer.

### Listing Tasks

```bash
letta cron list
```

Optional filters: `--agent <id>`, `--conversation <id>`

### Getting a Single Task

`get` accepts an ID or name:

```bash
letta cron get <id-or-name> [--agent <id>]
```

### Reading Run History

```bash
letta cron runs --id <task-id> [--limit <n>] [--agent <id>]
```

`--run-id <id>` selects one run.

### Binding a Task to the Right Conversation

If exact routing matters, pass both `--agent` and `--conversation` explicitly.

`letta cron add` falls back to `LETTA_AGENT_ID` for the agent. An omitted `--conversation` means `"new"`, so every fire gets a fresh conversation. Pass `--conversation self` to capture the current `LETTA_CONVERSATION_ID`, `--conversation default` for the agent default, or a concrete conversation ID.

Safest pattern:

```bash
letta cron add \
  --name "email-check" \
  --description "Daily email summary in this conversation" \
  --prompt "Check the user's email and post a summary here." \
  --cron "0 10 * * *" \
  --agent "$LETTA_AGENT_ID" \
  --conversation self
```

Then verify the binding explicitly:

```bash
letta cron list --agent "$LETTA_AGENT_ID" --conversation self
```

### Deleting or Replacing Tasks

`delete` accepts an ID or name; `remove` is an alias.

```bash
# Delete a specific task
letta cron delete <id-or-name> [--agent <id>]

# Delete all tasks for one agent
letta cron delete --all --agent "$AGENT_ID"
```

In-place editing is not available. To change a schedule, create and verify the replacement before deleting the old one.

## Timezones

Recurring expressions — `--cron`, and the expression `--every` compiles to — are interpreted in **the computer's local timezone**, captured when the task is created. Write the expression in the user's own wall-clock time and do not convert to UTC: a user in California asking for "9am daily" needs `--cron "0 9 * * *"`.

Because the timezone is captured at creation, a task keeps matching that same wall-clock time. If the computer later moves to another timezone and the user wants the schedule to follow it, delete the task and create it again.

For a one-shot calendar request such as "tomorrow at 9am," resolve the date in the user's timezone and pass `--at` an RFC 3339 timestamp with an explicit offset. Infer a reasonable timezone from available context instead of asking a redundant follow-up. State the timezone you used in the confirmation (for example, "Scheduled for 9:00 AM PT") so the user can correct the assumption. A bare clock such as `--at "9:00am"` uses this computer's timezone and schedules tomorrow if that time has already passed there. Relative values such as `--at "in 45m"` do not need a timezone.

## Examples

### "Remind me every morning at 9am to walk the dog" (user in UTC−7)

```bash
letta cron add \
  --name "dog-walk-reminder" \
  --description "Daily 9am (America/Los_Angeles) reminder to walk the dog" \
  --prompt "Hey! It's 9am — time to walk the dog." \
  --cron "0 9 * * *"
```

`--every 1d` also lands on midnight, so use `--cron` whenever the user names a time of day.

### "Check on the deploy in 30 minutes"

```bash
letta cron add \
  --name "deploy-check" \
  --description "One-time check on deployment status" \
  --prompt "Check the deployment status and report the result here." \
  --at "in 30m" \
  --agent "$LETTA_AGENT_ID" \
  --conversation self
```

### "Every weekday at 5pm, remind me to submit my timesheet" (user in UTC−7)

```bash
letta cron add \
  --name "timesheet-reminder" \
  --description "Weekday 5pm (America/Los_Angeles) timesheet reminder" \
  --prompt "Friendly reminder: don't forget to submit your timesheet before EOD!" \
  --cron "0 17 * * 1-5"
```

The day-of-week field is the user's own weekday because the expression is read in local time, so no day shift is needed.

### "What reminders do I have?"

```bash
letta cron list
```

If you need to confirm the exact conversation a task is bound to, list with explicit filters instead:

```bash
letta cron list --agent "$AGENT_ID" --conversation "$CONVERSATION_ID"
```

### "Cancel the dog walk reminder"

```bash
letta cron delete dog-walk-reminder
```

## Writing Good Prompts

The `--prompt` value is what gets sent to you (the agent) when the task fires. Write it as a message that will make sense when you receive it later, with enough context to act on:

- **Good**: "The user asked to be reminded to review the PR for the auth refactor. Check if it's still open and nudge them."
- **Bad**: "reminder"

Include context about what the user originally asked for, so you can give a helpful response when the prompt arrives.

## Important Notes

- **Minimum granularity**: 1 minute. Intervals under 60 seconds are rounded up.
- **Recurring tasks**: No longer auto-expire. They remain active until explicitly cancelled.
- **Terminal task cleanup**: A task that reached a terminal state — fired, missed, or cancelled — is removed 24 hours later.
- **Default binding**: `letta cron add` uses `--agent` first, then `LETTA_AGENT_ID`. Omit `--conversation` for a fresh conversation per fire; use `--conversation self` to capture `LETTA_CONVERSATION_ID` explicitly.
- **Scheduler requirement**: A schedule only fires while a Letta session is running on this computer; a fire that comes due while nothing is running is marked missed.
- **`--at` for specific times**: prefer RFC 3339 with an explicit offset. A bare `--at "3:00pm"` uses the process timezone and schedules tomorrow if that time has already passed there.
- **Creation failures are loud**: `letta cron add` exits nonzero and prints the reason to stderr, and no task is stored. Check the exit code instead of assuming the task exists.

## Cron Expression Reference

For `--cron`, use numeric 5-field cron syntax (named days/months, seconds, `?`, `L`, and `#` are not supported):

```
┌───────────── minute (0-59)
│ ┌───────────── hour (0-23)
│ │ ┌───────────── day of month (1-31)
│ │ │ ┌───────────── month (1-12)
│ │ │ │ ┌───────────── day of week (0-6, Sun=0)
│ │ │ │ │
* * * * *
```

Common patterns (read in the computer's local timezone):
- `*/5 * * * *` — every 5 minutes
- `0 */2 * * *` — every 2 hours
- `0 9 * * *` — daily at 9:00
- `0 9 * * 1-5` — weekdays at 9:00
- `30 8 1 * *` — 8:30 on the 1st of each month
