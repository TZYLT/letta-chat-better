/**
 * The one-shot no-marker nudge (feature ③, D-114).
 *
 * A conversation that runs `topic_nudge_turns` user turns without a marker gets
 * exactly one reminder per streak: the agent is told in its next message, and
 * the user sees a line in the terminal. The decision itself is
 * `decideTopicNudge` in `topic-compaction.ts`; this module is the small I/O
 * shell that reads the facts, settles the one-shot flag, and reports the reason.
 *
 * The flag is written when the nudge goes out and cleared on every other
 * outcome: a new marker (or a trim) starts a new streak, so a flag left over
 * from the previous one must not suppress the next nudge. A *disabled* nudge
 * (`nudge_turns = 0`) is not an outcome that ends a streak, so it leaves the flag
 * exactly as it found it. Losing one delivery is acceptable; repeating one is not,
 * which is why the write happens here rather than after a reminder has been
 * rendered.
 *
 * It runs against a port object rather than the backend so the "one write, and
 * only when it is due" ordering can be tested without a provider — the same
 * shape `local-topic-trim.ts` uses for the trim.
