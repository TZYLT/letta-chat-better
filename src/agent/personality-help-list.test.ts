/**
 * Guard for the personality preset list that help and error text print.
 *
 * `src/index.ts`, `src/headless.ts` and `src/cli/args.ts` all advertise the
 * accepted `--personality` values. `index.ts` and `headless.ts` sit at their
 * 1,000-line ratchet baseline, so they carry the list as a literal instead of
 * importing `PERSONALITY_OPTIONS` — which means adding or renaming a preset
 * would otherwise leave their error message advertising a value that no longer
 * exists (or hiding one that does).
 *
 * This test reads those literals out of the source and compares them with the
 * preset table, so the copy cannot drift silently.
