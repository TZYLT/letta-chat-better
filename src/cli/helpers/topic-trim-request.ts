/**
 * One-shot handoff from `/compact` to the topic picker.
 *
 * `/compact` runs inside the submit handler; the picker is rendered by the
 * "compaction" overlay slot in `AppView`. Those two live in different React
 * trees — the submit handler can open an overlay, but it cannot pass it props —
 * so the request travels through this bridge, exactly like
 * `@/utils/message-queue-bridge` carries background-task messages into the
 * transcript queue.
 *
 * It is deliberately single-consumer and one-shot: `takeTopicTrimRequest`
 * hands the request to the picker and clears it, so the picker that mounts for
 * `/compaction` (mode settings) cannot render a stale topic list. Every
 * `/compact` clears the slot before it decides, which covers the only remaining
 * case — a request parked by a run that never opened the overlay.
