 * picks the topic block to keep, and the compression rate
 * (`sliding_window_percentage`) survives as the hard limit every cut is
 * measured against — a pick may never *keep* more than the rate allows — and as
 * the fallback cut when nothing has been marked. The cloud backend keeps its own
 * mode-based behaviour, so mode words still parse — the local path is what
 * rejects them.
 *
 * Everything here is pure: the CLI and the listener share the parsing and the
 * receipts, and tests cover them without a backend.
