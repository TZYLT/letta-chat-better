/**
 * Report text for a personality swap on the local backend.
 *
 * `/personality` writes the new persona/human blocks into the memory repo and
 * commits them. Under strict prefix freeze that commit is only *registered*:
 * the conversation's applied snapshot keeps the old blocks until the next
 * application point (new conversation, compaction, `/recompile`).
 *
 * The wording therefore must not claim the swap already took effect, and the
 * handler must not recompile on the spot — doing so would apply a prefix change
 * from a non-application point and hide the registered state from
 * `/context-pending` (R-08).
