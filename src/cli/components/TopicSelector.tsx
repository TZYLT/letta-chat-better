/**
 * The topic picker (D-111): the overlay `/compact` opens when a conversation has
 * markers to choose between.
 *
 * Rows are built by a pure function so the copy, the ordering, and the cursor
 * default are testable without rendering Ink. The trailing row is always
 * "Cancel". Every block is selectable, including the first one: the compression
 * rate caps what any cut may keep, so "keep everything" resolves to the rate's
 * own cut instead of being a dead row. The row copy itself comes from
 * `helpers/topic-list.ts` so the picker and `/topics` describe a boundary the
 * same way.
