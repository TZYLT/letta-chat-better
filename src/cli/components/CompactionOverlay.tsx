/**
 * The "compaction" overlay slot, which is two selectors behind one name.
 *
 * `/compaction` configures the mode; `/compact` (with topic markers to choose
 * between) asks the submit handler for a cut point and parks a
 * {@link TopicTrimRequest} in `@/cli/helpers/topic-trim-request`. AppView renders
 * this component for both, so the picker needs no new props threaded through the
 * coordinator — the trim itself stays in the submit handler, which is the only
 * place with the compaction bookkeeping.
